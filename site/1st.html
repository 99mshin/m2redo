							The snow glows white on the mountain tonight Not a footprint to be
							seen A kingdom of isolation And it looks like I'm the queen The
							wind is howling like this swirling storm inside Couldn't keep it
							in, heaven knows I've tried Don't let them in, don't let them see
							Be the good girl you always have to be Conceal, don't feel, don't
							let them know Well, now they know Let it go, let it go Can't hold
							it back anymore Let it go, let it go Turn away and slam the door I
							don't care what they're going to say Let the storm rage on The
							cold never bothered me anyway It's funny how some distance makes
							everything seem small And the fears that once controlled me can't
							get to me at all It's time to see what I can do To test the limits
							and break through No right, no wrong, no rules for me I'm free Let
							it go, let it go I am one with the wind and sky Let it go, let it
							go You'll never see me cry Here I stand and here I stay Let the
							storm rage on My power flurries through the air into the ground My
							soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around And one thought
							crystallizes like an icy blast I'm never going back, the past is
							in the past Let it go, let it go When I'll rise like the break of
							dawn Let it go, let it go That perfect girl is gone Here I stand
							in the light of day Let the storm rage on The cold never bothered
							me anyway

							I've been staring at the edge of the water 'Long as I can
							remember, never really knowing why I wish I could be the perfect
							daughter But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
							Every turn I take, every trail I track Every path I make, every
							road leads back To the place I know, where I can not go, where I
							long to be See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
							And no one knows, how far it goes If the wind in my sail on the
							sea stays behind me One day I'll know, if I go there's just no
							telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island, seems so
							happy on this island Everything is by design I know everybody on
							this island has a role on this island So maybe I can roll with
							mine I can lead with pride, I can make us strong I'll be satisfied
							if I play along But the voice inside sings a different song What
							is wrong with me? See the light as it shines on the sea? It's
							blinding But no one knows, how deep it goes And it seems like it's
							calling out to me, so come find me And let me know, what's beyond
							that line, will I cross that line? The line where the sky meets
							the sea? It calls me And no one knows, how far it goes If the wind
							in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day I'll know, how far
							I'll go

							I can show you the world Shining, shimmering, splendid Tell me,
							princess, now when did You last let your heart decide? I can open
							your eyes Take you wonder by wonder Over, sideways and under On a
							magic carpet ride A whole new world A new fantastic point of view
							No one to tell us, "No" Or where to go Or say we're only dreaming
							A whole new world A dazzling place I never knew But when I'm way
							up here It's crystal clear That now I'm in a whole new world with
							you (Now I'm in a whole new world with you) Unbelievable sights
							Indescribable feeling Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling Through an
							endless diamond sky A whole new world (don't you dare close your
							eyes) A hundred thousand things to see (hold your breath, it gets
							better) I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far I can't go back
							to where I used to be A whole new world With new horizons to
							pursue I'll chase them anywhere There's time to spare Let me share
							this whole new world with you A whole new world (a whole new
							world) A new fantastic point of view No one to tell us, "No" Or
							where to go Or say we're only dreaming A whole new world (every
							turn, a surprise) With new horizons to pursue (every moment,
							red-letter) I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare And
							then we're home (there's time to spare) Let me share this whole
							new world with you A whole new world (a whole new world) That's
							where we'll be (that's where we'll be) A thrilling chase (a
							wondrous place) For you and me
